            <h3>What are the difference between map, filter, forEach and find?</h3>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Answer :</span>
                The method map returns a new array after executing some code on each of the array element. Filter also
                returns a new array after filtering each of the array element with the filtering condition. Find returns
                only one array element which first meets the condition. And forEach method returns undefined after
                performing some code on each array elements.

            <h3>What are the differences between local Storage, session storage and cookies?</h3>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Answer :</span>
                LocalStorage data is stored permanently until it is explicitly deleted by the user or the developer.
                SessionStorage data is stored only for the current session, which ends when the browser is closed.
                Cookies can be set to expire after a certain amount of time, or they can be set to expire when the
                browser is closed.

            <h3>WHat is an Event loop?</h3>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Answer :</span>
            An event loop is a programming construct that waits for and dispatches events in a program. When a
            function
            is called, it is added to the call stack. The event loop will execute the functions on the call stack until
            it is empty. If there are no functions on the call stack, the event loop will check the event queue for any
            events that need to be processed.</p>

            <h3>What does the quizTimer() function do?</h3>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Answer :</span>
                In the given project, quizTimer function evaluates and shows the time from starting the quiz in minutes
                and seconds. It uses setInterval asynchronous function to increment count variable after each second and
                then it converts that seconds to minutes and seconds to display it. If the time period exceeds 60
                seconds then it changes the color of time period to light and deep red alternatively.</p>

            <h3>What does the chooseQuiz() function do?</h3>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Answer :</span>

                The chooseQuiz() function is used to select an option for a quiz question. It takes two parameters: the
                index of the question and the selected option.

                The function first checks if the answer already exists in the answers array. If it does, the function
                updates the given answer for that question. Otherwise, the function adds a new object to the answers
                array with the question, the selected option, and the given answer.

                Finally, the function calls the displayAnswers() function to display the answers for the quiz.</p>
